## About Me

### (Under construction) 

I am a senior undergraduate student of [Weiyang College](https://www.wyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), major in Mathmatics and Physics. My research interests in 3D vision, Reasoning & Scene Understanding, and RL. I also have a keen interest in mathematics, especially in geometry. 

In 2023 summer, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), working on projects about 3D vision and vision question answering(VQA).


## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** 3D reconstruction, vision question answering

- **Reasoning :** relational and temporal models for reasoning


## News

- **[June. 2023]** Summer intern at [CCVL](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), Johns Hopkins University.

## Teaching

- TA, Calculus A at Tsinghua University, 2022 fall
